Long term, we support the commercial aviation industry’s ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for global civil aviation operations by 2050.
In October 2021, we announced our support for the commercial aviation industry’s ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for global civil aviation operations by 2050.
By supporting this industry goal, we are addressing emissions from the use of Boeing’s sold commercial aircraft (Scope 3 Category 11) which is estimated to comprise greater than 90% of Boeing’s total GHG emissions, and therefore defined as the only relevant category of Scope 3 emissions for Boeing under the Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Benchmark.1
Our active support for the commercial aviation industry’s net-zero ambition largely — but not fully — aligns with the Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Indicator objective for addressing Scope 3 emissions.
In support of a net-zero transition, the first step is to ensure we have a path that is credible and aligned with the commercial aviation industry in support of its global reduction goals.
Boeing’s existing Scope 3 ambitions to support our commercial industry’s net-zero goals do not address (i) our defense portfolio, where we are actively working with our government customers to understand and support their future requirements, or (ii) our supply chain, where we are working with our suppliers to increase GHG reporting and proactively address climate change-driven risks to create resilience and stability within our supply base.
