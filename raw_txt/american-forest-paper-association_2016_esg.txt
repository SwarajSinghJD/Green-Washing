Member efforts to increase efficiencies and further enhance sustainability performance within their companies resulted in the early achievement of our safety and greenhouse gas emission goals.
Our industry’s commitment to sustainability reaches far beyond fulfillment of the Better Practices, Better Planet 2020 goals.

It has enabled the mill to put net power to the grid, greatly reduce coal use and greenhouse gas emissions, and de- crease freshwater usage and the generation of wastewater, while providing a market for bark and other byproducts from the forest.
Increase the amount of fiber procured from certified forestlands or through certified fiber sourcing programs in the U.S. from 2005 to 2020 and work to decrease illegal logging 2014 LEADERSHIP IN SUSTAINABILITY AWARDS FOR SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT:
WestRock’s Internal Fiber Supply Chain Certification Program WestRock (then RockTenn) achieved its sustainability goal to achieve fiber chain-of- custody certification to credible third-party forestry certifications at all its North American wholly owned manufacturing facilities by 2020 in 2013, creating the single largest multisite fiber chain-of-custody certification in the U.S. paper industry.
The amount of wood fiber members procured from certified sourcing programs increased from 87 percent in 2005 to 98 percent in 2014.
WOOD FIBER PROCURED FROM CERTIFIED FIBER SOURCING PROGRAMS GOAL 2005 2010 2012 2014 Baseline Wood fiber sourced by members from third party certified forestlands increased from 23 percent in 2005 to 29 percent in 2014.
Although we have met the goal to reduce reportable incidents, we continue to look for new ways to achieve our aspirational goal of zero workplace injuries.
These water conserva- tion efforts also reduced costs required for heating, pumping and treating water, and 9000 support ongoing resource conservation efforts at the mill.
These reductions have come about through member adoption of efficient manufacturing production measures, increased use of less carbon-intensive fossil fuels and carbon-neutral biomass-based energy sources.
Due to state Renewable Portfolio Standards, environmental regulations and market forces, the GHG intensity of purchased electricity has decreased 15 percent between 2005 and 2012.
To make our measurements more comparable over time, however, we have held constant at 2005 levels national GHG emission factors associated with electricity2 and steam3 purchased by our mills and not reflected that decrease.
If we adjust our reduction calculations to reflect the changes in the grid and to reflect the locations of our members’ mills, they would have achieved a 20.4 percent reduction from 2005 to 2014.4 Member GHG Reductions Make a Difference GHG releases from member facilities in 2014 were lower by 37 million tons CO equivalents when compared to 2 emissions from member facilities in 2000.
Energy Production and Efficiency AF&PA member manufacturing facilities obtain energy 2014 LEADERSHIP IN SUSTAINABILITY AWARD from a number of sources to support operations.

Between 2000 and 2010, AF&PA member pulp and paper 2 8 mills reduced the amount of water needed to produce one ton of product by 15.2 percent.
Based on analysis of 2006 data by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement (NCASI) 7 Based on NCASI analysis 18 --- PAGE 21 --- Doing More with Less Through the use of science and technology, AF&PA members strive for continuous improvements that “decouple” the demand for goods and services from the demand for natural resources and emissions.
As we get closer to background levels of emissions, it becomes much more challenging and costly to achieve continued reductions.

Below are some examples of ways in which our members are working to improve their communities.
Clearwater Paper donates an annual $10,000, and employees have volunteered hundreds of hours planting trees, weeding and providing general clean-up services for the Lindsay Creek stream bank, helping to radically improve the wildlife habitat, water quality and the area’s visual appeal.
Domtar’s BioChoice Lignin plant produces new value streams out of existing resources, offering a timely solution for those looking to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels.
