The overall increase on ROM basis is 1% Digital Twin model development Internal recirculation reduced from 23% to 20% increasing Sinter yield thereby lowering energy consumption.
Test work with different dispersants showed that alumina could be reduced by 0.2-0.3% in Gradient Boost, Random Forrest The same predicted parameters are made available in a web based platform, named IQMS to concerned addition to the reduction achieved by washing with water alone.
